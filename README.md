#Personal Portfolio Website

This is a simple personal portfolio website created as part of my internship. It showcases basic information about me, my skills, projects, and a contact section in a clean and beginner-friendly layout.

##Features

The website includes an About section with a short introduction, a Skills section listing technical and soft skills, a Projects section highlighting academic and internship work, and a Contact section with a basic contact form. The layout is responsive and easy to navigate.

##Technologies Used

HTML5 is used for structuring the content, CSS3 is used for styling and layout, and JavaScript is used for basic interaction in the contact form.

##Folder Structure

The project contains an index.html file for the main structure, a style.css file for styling, a script.js file for basic functionality, a README.md file for project information, and an images folder that stores the profile image used in the website.

##How to Run the Project

To run the project, download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in any web browser. The portfolio website will load locally without any additional setup.

##Note

The contact form is for demonstration purposes only and does not send real emails.
