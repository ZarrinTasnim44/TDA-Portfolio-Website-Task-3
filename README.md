Interactive Portfolio Website (Task 3 – JavaScript Enhancement)

This project is Task 3, created as a continuation of the portfolio website developed in Task 1 (HTML) and Task 2 (CSS styling).

In this task, JavaScript functionality is added to the existing styled portfolio without modifying the design or layout, focusing only on interactivity and user experience.

Project Overview and Objectives

The main objective of this task is to enhance the already styled portfolio website by adding JavaScript-based interactive features.

The goals of this task are:

To add JavaScript interactivity to the existing portfolio

To validate user input in the contact form

To handle user events using JavaScript

To manipulate the DOM dynamically

To implement a dark mode toggle feature

To store user preferences using localStorage

Setup and Installation Instructions

This project does not require any installation or external software.

Steps to run the project:

Download or clone the project folder

Make sure the following files and folders are present:

index.html

style.css

script.js

images folder (containing the profile image)

Open index.html in any modern web browser

The website will load directly as it is a static project

JavaScript Features Added (Task 3)
1. Contact Form Validation

JavaScript is used to validate the contact form fields:

Ensures the name field is not empty

Validates the email format using a regular expression

Ensures the message field is not empty

Prevents form submission if validation fails

2. Error Message Display

Displays clear error messages below each input field

Error messages are added and removed dynamically using DOM manipulation

3. Real-Time User Interaction

Error messages disappear automatically as the user starts typing

Implemented using input event listeners

4. Success Message on Submission

Displays a success message after successful form validation

Automatically clears the form after submission

5. Dark Mode Toggle

A dark mode toggle button is added to the navigation bar

Allows users to switch between light and dark themes

Improves accessibility and user experience

6. Theme Persistence Using LocalStorage

The selected theme (light or dark mode) is saved using localStorage

The preferred theme remains active even after refreshing the page

JavaScript Concepts Used

DOM manipulation (getElementById, textContent, classList)

Event listeners (submit, input, click)

Client-side form validation

Regular expressions for email validation

Reusable JavaScript functions

LocalStorage

Conclusion

This task successfully enhances the styled portfolio website by adding JavaScript interactivity.
The project meets all Task 3 requirements and demonstrates the practical use of JavaScript concepts while keeping the original design unchanged.
